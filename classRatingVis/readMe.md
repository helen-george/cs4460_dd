The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) allows property owners to buy flood insurance. In exchange, communities agree to follow rules that help prevent flood damage and protect lives. The NFIP Community Status Book dataset shows which communities can offer flood insurance to their residents and whether they can get help after a disaster. It also includes information about discounts on insurance for communities that take part in the Community Rating System (CRS).

Important Attributes: 

Class Rating: this goes from a 1-9 scale. A CRS rating of 1 is the highest possible rating a community can achieve in the Community Rating System (CRS). It means the community has implemented excellent floodplain management practices that go above and beyond the minimum requirements. As a result, residents of that community receive the maximum possible discount (45%) on their flood insurance premiums. Communities with a CRS rating of 1 are recognized for their outstanding efforts to reduce flood risks and improve floodplain management.

Currently Effective Map Date: Date of the flood map currently in effect

My bar chart shows that communities in the south east don't have high class ratings and therefore don't recieve discounts on flood insurance. it also shows the average time in each state for communities to update their flood maps, which revealed that communities are not updating their flood maps frequently enough.
